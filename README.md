# BioData Club Kit
To be successful, translational and informatics research is increasingly dependent upon team science, data science expertise, and open science practices. While many institutions provide some training in these areas, there are content gaps and many resources are locked behind formal course offerings or go beyond the basic skills that people need to work together.  Moreover, training opportunities are often delivered with a very specific audience in mind.  Students across diciplines are not learning together nor building a common language for how to collaborate. 




However, it is a challenge to identify or create community building models, learning strategies, and content that appeals across domains and can be leveraged and adopted to implement these types of learning initiatives. At OHSU, BioData Club is a successful community building forum and Data Science/Open Science training resource. The BioData Club kit deliverables produced in phase 1 provide CTSA hubs and institutional stakeholders with resources and guidance for implementing similar initiatives at their institutions. Our phase 2 work will be focused on piloting the implementation of the BioData Club Kit at least 2 CTSA hubs. 


## Talking Points

## We're different than a MOOC because ...


## We're different than a Meetup because ...

- Collaborative Angle
- Interdisciplinary
- Learning environment
- Team Science Skills
    - Data Science as a Unifying Activity
    - Team Science soft skills
    - Build confidence to collaborate across fields
    - We are not intimidated of each other because we socialize together
- Our activities are team focused and inclusive

- A community of practice is a community of collaboration

BioData Club Kit is a blueprint for changing culture at your institution by breaking down silo-ed departments through a desire to learn together.

## Problem statement
Please include a Project Statement on your landing page. Your problem statement should be in the form of: What can CTSAs/the community not do now, that would be addressed by this project's success? A problem statement should be a clear vision and the overall method that will be used to solve the problem at hand. 

## Project description
(we will migrate these from the Project Matrix for you)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum pretium a felis non scelerisque. Etiam molestie nisi ut mi viverra dictum. Nunc et tempor quam. Maecenas a viverra sapien. Aliquam lacinia sagittis lorem ac sodales. Fusce justo mi, cursus sed metus sed, ornare vestibulum mauris. Donec in orci ornare, facilisis nisl ut, congue libero.

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

Point person (github handle) | Site | Program Director
----------|--------------|---------------
Julie McMurry (@jmcmurry) | OHSU | Melissa Haendel (@mellybelly)

## Leads 

Project scientific leadership, should be 1-3 persons.

## Team members 

No action required here, a list of team members will be imported and linked below.

See https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories

List all of the Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the project management layer. The "PM layer" constitutes the readme.md, education.md, evaluation.md, engagment.md as well as the milestones and issues.

You can either add the PM layer to an existing repository, or create a new repository for this and instead list the associated repositories below. Please be sure to tag any related repositories (whether or not they are already under the data2health organization) with the topic 'data2health'. The repository associated with the PM layer must be public. Other repositories associated with the project (where applicable) may be private for reasons of sensitivity or privacy. 

### Example repos:
This list can be omitted if you have only one repo (one and the same with the PM layer).
Otherwise, list the other project-associated repos that live inside or outside the data2health GitHub organization.
Note that only one repo per project needs to contain the PM layer. That is to say, don't add education to every repo in a project etc.

## Deliverables
Each project should propose one or more deliverables. Examples: a released code package, a best practices document, a final survey, a set of survey results, etc.

## Milestones 
Each deliverable is represented as a Milestone, but not all Milestones need be deliverables. For example, see this 'report on XYZ' is a [Deliverable Milestone](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/milestone/2)

Please create 4-8 Milestones for each project, with dates prior to August 31st.  Milestones for partially completed deliverables are acceptable: beta release of software, # interviews performed, 75% coverage, etc. 

Each Milestone must have at least one Issue (aka 'ticket'), each issue should be assigned to a person, preferably one at a time; reassignments are fine. Issues with checklists showing degree of completion are also acceptable, see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).

GitHub help on Milestones is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/)

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
[Documentating projects in Github](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

[The project Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vLp-H32KTNobiZF2cK82At90S6dVJNUf) is accessible to onboarded participants. 

## Slack room
[The project slack room](https://cd2h.slack.com/messages/C9D9SQWEQ) is accessible to onboarded participants. You will not automatically be added to Slack, please join via the link above.
