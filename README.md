# BioData Club Kit
The BioData Club Kit helps a CTSA hubs facilitate community building, support new collaborations, and improve translational workforce competency in data and open science.

## Problem statement
To be successful, translational and informatics research is increasingly dependent upon team science, data science expertise, and open science practices. While many institutions provide some training in these areas, there are content gaps and many resources are locked behind formal course offerings or go beyond the basic skills that people need to work together. Moreover, training opportunities are often delivered with a very specific audience in mind. Students across disciplines are not learning together nor building a common language for how to collaborate.

## Project description
BioData Club Kit is a model and set of resources which enable groups and institutions to bring people together from multiple disciplines for hands-on learning. It provides educational content for open science and data science skill building that is relevant across disciplines. The Kitâ€™s content, tools, and pedagogical approach promote a fun and collaborative environment to learn from each other, and builds confidence to collaborate across fields. Use the BioData Club Kit to support career development and to increase collaboration at your CTSA community.
